  <h1>Project Title??</h1>
  
  <body>
    <h2>Introduction Paragraph</h2>
    <p>“Suppose a computer manufacturer develops a new machine architecture. To what extent should the company be allowed to own that architecture? What policy would be best for society?” If someone creates “architecture” or some kind of new device they should be allowed to own their “version” of said device. Currently this exists in the form of smartphones. There are many companies that create and sell smartphones for profit, but none of them actually own the concept of the smartphone. This, I believe, is the best way for this to be handled for society, however the problem arises when companies begin to create subpar quality products and sell their brand rather than their device.</p>

    <h2>Something else here not sure</h2>
    <p>WORDS WORDS WORDS</p>
  
    <h2>NINTENDO SHENANIGANS</h2>
    <p>The only conflicting opinions are the people versus the company. </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I need to find places that have reasonable insight on patent shenanigans.</p>
