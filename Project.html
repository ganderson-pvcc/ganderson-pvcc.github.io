  <h1>How to Patent Your Products Ethically (kind of)</h1>
  
  <body>
    <h2>Introduction Paragraph</h2>
    <p>“Suppose a computer manufacturer develops a new machine architecture. To what extent should the company be allowed to own that architecture? What policy would be best for society?” If someone creates “architecture” or some kind of new device they should be allowed to own their “version” of said device. Currently this exists in the form of smartphones. There are many companies that create and sell smartphones for profit, but none of them actually own the concept of the smartphone. This, I believe, is the best way for this to be handled for society, however the problem arises when companies begin to create subpar quality products and sell their brand rather than their device.</p>

    <h2>Tesla's Cybertruck, A Low, High Quality Product</h2>
    <p>However some companies actually care about making quality products even if they still try to sell the brand rather than the quality. Take Tesla’s cybertruck, one of the best, worst designs ever made that people only buy because of the insane marketing strategy and strange look. Tesla has made one of the most durable cars that in the event of a crash will stay largely undamaged and intact. Which would be good but unfortunately people have to drive it, and if the car doesn’t break then the people will. The patents for the Tesla Cybertruck are all reasonable and about the actual architecture and design of the vehicle rather than the idea of a crash resistant truck, and that is a good thing.</p>
  
    <h2>How Not Patent Something</h2>
    <p>One of the clearest examples of a company attempting to abuse the system where people purchase the brand, or concept, of a product rather than the actual product itself, is Nintendo’s recent suit against Palworld. Palworld was released January 19, 2024, and recently, September 9, 2024, Nintendo created a patent protecting the concept of Pokemon which is what Palworld is based off of. There are a large number of problems with this, first of all, Nintendo created this patent NINE MONTHS after the release of Palworld, there was enough time for a human baby to be conceived and born between the release of Palworld and the creation of the patent Nintendo is basing their entire suit on. Second of all, Nintendo applied for this patent in the United States and it was denied; hence the “JP” at the start of the patent signifying it’s from Japan and only enforceable in Japan. And last, but not least, these are video games designed for consumer entertainment. There shouldn’t be intense competition between multiple companies as games shouldn’t be competing to take up as much of people’s time as possible. The existence of Palworld is not going to reduce the sales of the next Pokemon game Nintendo releases.  </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Overall the issue of companies selling people intentionally low quality products because they go all in on branding and marketing is a societal problem at its core. Because people like shiny things that suck more than ugly things that are amazing, someone else will exploit that for a profit, as is the nature of capitalism. It has its upsides and downsides but you cannot realistically make a change without people starting to just not buy bad products. However you can attempt to get legislation passed that sets the standard for individual market items and their quality that must be thoroughly tested before being placed on shelves.</p>
